Building jwordpress from source:
------------------------------

First read the attached COPYING file before using this software anywhere. It's
free, but just in case...

In order to install, you need java and maven. Maven is available at
http://maven.apache.org/ . I compiled it via Java 7, it may work with previous
Java versions but some classes in commons library may be incompatible, so
you'll have to figure it out.

Before all, you need to set up JAVA_HOME environment variable. In OSX Mountain
Lion, I use: export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`

mvn clean :
    This cleans up the target directory, if you feel like building again.

mvn package :
    This will create target zip and jar files under the 'target' directory.

    You need to setup a dummy wordpress installation at
    http://wordpressjava-test.local. A Vagrant configuration is provided
    in vagrant-test/ directory

    DO NOT USE A PRODUCTION BLOG FOR TESTING. Tests are destructive.

    jwordpess-{version}-cliapi.zip will contain a jar file and the wrapper
    script for running the command line interface. Try './jwordpress -?'
    for a list of command line options.

    jwordpress-{version}.jar is the jar file that you want to use in your
    code

mvn javadoc:javadoc :
    This will generate javadocs under doc/ directory.

./install.sh
    This will install files to /usr prefix by default, you can change the
    installation prefix by './install.sh (somewhereelse)'.
    Make sure to run 'mvn package' before this script.
